Title: Facebook match-maker
Team Members: Amol Patil, Ankit Junnarkar
What are we trying to do?
Humankinds are easily influenced by the people around them, with whom they spend most of their time or people whom they like the most. 
There is a good possibility that such humankinds follow likes and interests of compatible people. Facebook activity is a good indication 
of a persons close social circle and can be used to find his/her compatibility with them.
We are trying to develop a predictive application which analyzes the facebook profile of a person and predicts compatible people and 
interests for a given person based on his/her Facebook activity. To do so, the application would perform sophisticated analysis of 
person�s Facebook activity which includes analysis of the following: 
-	Age group
-	Profession 
-	Gender 
-	Geographical location
-	Numerology 
-	Zodiac compatibility 
-	Name compatibility 
-	Photo tags 
-	Check-ins 
-	Likes 
Interests of compatible people found from the above analysis are suggested to the person. We plan to use the Facebook/Graph/User API 
which gives access to all the above mentioned attributes of the user. Algorithm for numerological and zodiac compatibility can be developed 
using the user�s birthdate. Name compatibility algorithm is based on the sequence of vowels and consonants in the name. 
The combination of all the above attributes can give a strong compatibility analysis for the user. For example, Aries and Taurus have strong 
zodiac compatibility, number 1 and 6 have strong numerological compatibility, name Adam and Eve have strong name compatibility (about 86%).
Why are we doing this?
This application is purely for entertainment purpose. This application would entertain the user by showing him/her the list of most 
compatible people and their interests, if not his/her close social circle. Apart from the entertainment value, knowing the interests of 
a person could be very useful when it comes to deciding gifts for him/her or shopping for special occasions. 
It would also help improve advertisement by suggesting the user likes of his/her close friends. And more over there is no such application for Facebook yet.
